Class_12_Figure 1.1.jpg,A diagrammatic representation of L.S. of a flower To a biologist flowers are morphological and embryological marvels and the sites of sexual reproduction.  In earlier classes you have read the various parts of a flower.  Figure 1.1 will help you recall the parts of a typical flower. Flowers are objects of aesthetic ornamental social religious and cultural value– they have always been used as symbols for conveying important human feelings such as love affection
Class_12_Figure 1.2.jpg,A typical stamen three–dimensional cut section of an anther Figure 1.2a shows the two parts of a typical stamen – the long and slender stalk called the filament and the terminal generally bilobed structure alled the anther. A typical angiosperm anther is bilobed with each lobe having two theca i.e. they are dithecous (Figure 1.2b). Often a longitudinal groove runs lengthwise separating the theca.
Class_12_Figure 1.3.jpg,Transverse section of a young anther Enlarged view of one microsporangium showing wall layers A mature dehisced anther The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC) through meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores as they are formed are arranged in a cluster of four cells–the microspore tetrad (Figure 1.3a).  As the anthers mature and dehydrate the microspores dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 1.3 b). Inside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen grains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther (Figure 1.3c).
Class_12_Figure 1.4.jpg,Pollen grain: The pollen grains represent the male gametophytes.If you touch the opened anthers of Hibiscus or any other flower you would find deposition of yellowish powdery pollen grains on your fingers. Sprinkle these grains on a drop of water taken on a glass slide and observe under  a microscope.  You will really be amazed at the variety of architecture sizes shapes colours designs – seen on the pollen grains from different species (Figure 1.4).
Class_12_Figure 1.5.jpg,When the pollen grain is mature it contains two cells the vegetative cell and generative cell (Figure 1.5b).  The vegetative cell is bigger has abundant food reserve and a large irregularly shaped nucleus. The generative cell is small and floats in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell.
Class_12_Figure 1.6.jpg, In western countries a large number of  pollen products in the form of tablets and syrups are available in the market. Pollen consumption has been claimed to increase the performance of athletes and race horses (Figure 1.6).
Class_12_Figure 1.7.jpg, The gynoecium represents the female reproductive part of the flower.  The gynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have more than one pistil (multicarpellary).  When there are more than one the pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 1.7b) or may be free (apocarpous) (Figure 1.7c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 1.7a) the stigma style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform for pollen grains.
Class_12_Figure 1.8.jpg,It is a large cell containing dense cytoplasm and a prominent nucleus. The MMC undergoes meiotic division. What is the importance of the MMC undergoing meiosis? Meiosis results in the production of four megaspores (Figure 1.8a). Let us study about the formation of the embryo sac in detail. (Figure 1.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles forming the 2 nucleate embryo sac. After the 8-nucleate stage cell walls are laid down leading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte or embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac (Figure 1.8b c).  Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and organised into cells
Class_12_Figure 1.9.jpg, Autogamy : In this type pollination is achieved within the same flower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower (Figure 1.9a). Some plants such as Viola (common pansy) Oxalis and Commelina produce two types of flowers chasmogamous flowers which are similar to flowers of other species with exposed anthers and stigma and cleistogamous flowers which do not open at all (Figure 1.9c).Xenogamy – Transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure 1.9b). 
Class_12_Figure 1.10.jpg,Wind pollination also requires that the pollen grains are light and non-sticky so that they can be transported in wind currents. They often possess well-exposed stamens (so that the pollens are easily dispersed into wind currents Figure 1.10) and large often-feathery stigma to easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind pollinated flowers often have a single ovule in each ovary and numerous flowers packed into an inflorescence
Class_12_Figure 1.11.jpg,In Vallisneria the female flower reach the surface of water by the long stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the surface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure 1.11a)Bees butterflies flies beetles wasps ants moths birds (sunbirds and humming birds)  and bats are the common pollinating agents. (Figure 1.11b). 
Class_12_Figure 1.12a.jpg,As mentioned earlier following compatible pollination the pollen grain germinates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the germ pores (Figure 1.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into the pollen tube
Class_12_Figure 1.12b.jpg,Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and style and reaches the ovary (Figure 1.12b c). You would recall that in some plants pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative cell and a generative cell).
Class_12_Figure 1.12c.jpg,Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and style and reaches the ovary (Figure 1.12b c). You would recall that in some plants pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative cell and a generative cell).
Class_12_Figure 1.12d.jpg,Pollen tube after reaching the ovary enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of the synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 1.12d e). Many recent studies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part of the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube.
Class_12_Figure 1.12e.jpg,Pollen tube after reaching the ovary enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of the synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 1.12d e). Many recent studies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part of the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube.
Class_12_Figure 1.13.jpg,The other male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central cell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN) (Figure 1.13a). As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it is termed triple fusion. Fertilised embryo sac showing zygote and Primary Endosperm Nucleus (PEN) Stages in embryo development in a dicot
Class_12_Figure 1.14.jpg,A typical dicot embryo  L.S. of an embryo of grass  A typical dicotyledonous embryo (Figure 1.14a) consists of an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The portion of embryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is the epicotyl which terminates with the plumule or stem tip Embryos of monocotyledons (Figure 1.14 b) possess only one cotyledon. In the grass family the cotyledon is called scutellum that is situated towards one side (lateral) of the embryonal axis. 
Class_12_Figure 1.15.jpg,Structure of some seeds. False fruits of apple and strawberry Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats (Figure 1.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat. This facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination. However in a few species such as apple strawberry cashew etc. the thalamus  also contributes to fruit formation. Such fruits are called false fruits (Figure 1.15b).
Class_12_Figure 2.1a.jpg,Diagrammatic sectional view of male pelvis showing reproductive system The male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region (Figure 2.1a). The penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 2.1a b). It is made up of special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination. The enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold of skin called foreskin.
Class_12_Figure 2.1b.jpg,Diagrammatic view of male reproductive system The testis is covered by a dense covering. Each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules Figure 2.1(a) Diagrammatic sectional view of male pelvis showing reproductive system The penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 2.1a b). It is made up of special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination. The enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold of skin called foreskin. (Figure 2.1b). The male accessory glands (Figure 2.1a b) include paired seminal vesicles a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. 
Class_12_Figure 2.2.jpg,Diagrammatic sectional view of seminiferous tubule
Class_12_Figure 2.3a.jpg, The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries alongwith a pair of oviducts uterus cervix vagina and the external genitalia located in pelvic region (Figure 2.3a).  The female external genitalia include mons pubis labia majora labia minora hymen and clitoris (Figure 2.3a).
Class_12_Figure 2.3b.jpg,Ovaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female gamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). The ovaries are located one on each side of the lower abdomen (Figure 2.3b) The oviducts (fallopian tubes) uterus and vagina constitute the female accessory ducts. Each fallopian tube is about 10-12 cm long and extends from the periphery of each ovary to the uterus (Figure 2.3b) The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of the cervix is called cervical canal (Figure 2.3b) which alongwith vagina forms the birth canal
Class_12_Figure 2.4.jpg,The mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain glandular tissue and variable amount of fat. The glandular tissue of each breast is divided into 15-20 mammary lobes containing clusters of cells called alveoli (Figure 2.4). The cells of alveoli secrete milk which is stored in the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.
Class_12_Figure 2.5.jpg,The secondary spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic division to produce four equal haploid spermatids (Figure 2.5). What would be the number of chromosome in the spermatids? The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (sperms) by the process called spermiogenesis. 
Class_12_Figure 2.6.jpg, Let us examine the structure of a sperm. It is a microscopic structure composed of a head neck a middle piece and a tail (Figure 2.6). A plasma membrane envelops the whole body of sperm. The sperm head contains an elongated haploid nucleus the anterior portion of which is covered by a cap-like structure acrosome.
Class_12_Figure 2.7.jpg,Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the primary follicle (Figure 2.7). A large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. Therefore at puberty only 60000-80000 primary follicles are left in each ovary
Class_12_Figure 2.8.jpg,It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large haploid secondary oocyte and a tiny first polar body (Figure 2.8b).
Class_12_Figure 2.9.jpg,In human females menstruation is repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days and the cycle of events starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the menstrual cycle. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle  of each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are shown in Figure 2.9. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. These changes in the ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 2.9). The ovulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the corpus luteum (Figure 2.9).
Class_12_Figure 2.10.jpg,During fertilisation a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum (Figure 2.10) and induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms.
Class_12_Figure 2.11.jpg,The mitotic division  starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus of the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus (Figure 2.11) and forms 2 4 8 16 daughter cells called blastomeres. The embryo with 8 to 16  blastomeres is called a morula (Figure 2.11e). The morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 2.11g) as it moves further into the uterus
Class_12_Figure 2.12.jpg,The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between developing embryo (foetus) and maternal body called placenta (Figure 2.12).
Class_12_Figure 3.1a.jpg, In barrier methods ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such methods  are available for both males and females. Condoms (Figure 3.1 a b) are barriers made of thin rubber/ latex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or vagina and cervix in the female just before coitus so that the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female reproductive tract.
Class_12_Figure 3.1b.jpg,In barrier methods ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such methods are available for both males and females. Condoms (Figure 3.1 a b) are barriers made of thin rubber/ latex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or vagina and cervix in the female just before coitus so that the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female reproductive tract.
Class_12_Figure 3.2.jpg,These Intra Uterine Devices are presently available as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g. Lippes loop) copper releasing IUDs (CuT Cu7 Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs (Progestasert LNG-20) (Figure 3.2).
Class_12_Figure 3.3.jpg,Progestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used by females as injections or implants under the skin (Figure 3.3). Their mode of action is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are much longer. 
Class_12_Figure 3.4a.jpg,In vasectomy a small part of the vas deferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum (Figure 3.4a) whereas in tubectomy a small part of the fallopian tube is removed (Figure 3.4b) or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen or through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their reversibility is very poor.
Class_12_Figure 3.4b.jpg,In vasectomy a small part of the vas deferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum (Figure 3.4a) whereas in tubectomy a small part of the fallopian tube is removed (Figure 3.4b) or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen or through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their reversibility is very poor.
Class_12_Figure 4.1.jpg, Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties as pairs which were similar except for one character with contrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or wrinkled seeds yellow or green seeds inflated (full) or constricted green or yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 4.1 Table 4.1).
Class_12_Figure 4.2.jpg,Let us take the example of one such hybridisation experiment carried out by Mendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea plants to study the inheritance of one gene (Figure 4.2). He collected the seeds produced as a result of this cross and grew them to generate plants of the first hybrid generation.
Class_12_Figure 4.3.jpg,The proportion of plants that were dwarf were Figure 4.2 Steps in making a cross in pea 1/4th of the F2 plants while 3/4th of the F2 plants were tall. The tall and dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any blending that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf none were of inbetween height (Figure 4.3).  Diagrammatic representation of monohybrid cross
Class_12_Figure 4.4.jpg,A Punnett square used to understand a typical monohybrid cross conducted by Mendel between true-breeding tall plants and true-breeding dwarf plants  The production of gametes by the parents the formation of the zygotes the F1 and F2 plants can be understood from a diagram called Punnett Square as shown in Figure 4.4. It was developed by a British geneticist Reginald C. Punnett.
Class_12_Figure 4.5.jpg,Diagrammatic representation of a test cross The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to predict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 4.5 shows the results of typical test cross where violet colour flower (V) is dominant over white colour flower (v) That is for example whether a tall plant from F1 or F2 has TT or Tt composition cannot be predicted. Therefore to determine the genotype of a tall plant at F2  Mendel crossed the tall plant from F2 with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross.
Class_12_Figure 4.6.jpg,Results of monohybrid cross in the plant Snapdragon where one allele is incompletely dominant over the other allele In a cross between true-breeding red-flowered (RR) and truebreeding white-flowered plants (rr)  the F1 (Rr) was pink (Figure 4.6).  When the F1  was self-pollinated the F2  resulted in the following ratio 1 (RR) Red: 2 (Rr) Pink: 1 (rr) White.
Class_12_Figure 4.7.jpg,Results of a dihybrid cross where the two parents differed in two pairs of contrasting traits: seed colour and seed shape Mendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two characters as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with yellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour and wrinkled shape (Figure 4.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting from the crossing of the parents had yellow coloured and round shaped seeds.
Class_12_Figure 4.8.jpg,Meiosis and germ cell formation in a cell with four chromosomes Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of chromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used chromosome movement (Figure 4.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 4.3). Recall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis (equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division).
Class_12_Figure 4.9.jpg,Independent assortment of chromosomes  During Anaphase of meiosis I the two chromosome pairs can align at the metaphase plate independently of each other (Figure 4.9). To understand this compare the chromosomes of four different colour in the left and right columns.
Class_12_Figure 4.10.jpg,Drosophila melanogaster  Morgan worked with the tiny fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 4.10) which were found very suitable for such studies. They could be grown on simple synthetic medium in the laboratory.
Class_12_Figure 4.11.jpg,Linkage: Results of two dihybrid crosses conducted by Morgan. Cross A shows crossing between gene y and w; Cross B shows crossing between genes w and m. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 4.11). Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on  the same chromosome some genes were very tightly linked (showed very low recombination) (Figure 4.11 Cross A) while others were loosely linked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 4.11 Cross B). 
Class_12_Figure 4.12ab.jpg,Determination of sex by chromosomal differences: (ab) Both in humans and in Drosophila the female has a pair of XX chromosomes (homogametic) and the male XY (heterogametic) composition Females however have a pair of Xchromosomes. Both males and females bear same number of autosomes. Hence the males have autosomes plus XY while female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings  and in Drosophila the males have one X and one Y chromosome whereas females have a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 4.12 a b)
Class_12_Figure 4.12c.jpg,In many birds female has a pair of dissimilar chromosomes ZW and male two similar ZZ chromosomes But in both cases males produce two different types of gametes (a) either with or without X chromosome or (b) some gametes with X-chromosome and some with Y-chromosome. Such types of sex determination mechanism is designated to be the example of male heterogamety. In some other organisms e.g. birds a different mechanism of sex determination is observed (Figure 4.12 c).
Class_12_Figure 4.13a.jpg,Sex determination in honey bee . The females are diploid having 32 chromosomes and males are haploid i.e. having 16 chromosomes. This is called as haplodiploid sex-determination system and has special characteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis (Figure 4.13) they do not have father and thus cannot have sons but have a grandfather and can have grandsons.
Class_12_Figure 4.13b.jpg,Symbols used in the human pedigree analysis In human genetics pedigree study provides a strong tool which is utilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait abnormality or disease. Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis have been shown in Figure 4.13.
Class_12_Figure 4.14.jpg,Representative pedigree analysis of (a) Autosomal dominant trait (for example: Myotonic dystrophy) (b) Autosomal recessive trait (for example: Sickle-cell anaemia)  Similarly the trait may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is evident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier female to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 4.14 for dominant and recessive traits. 
Class_12_Figure 4.15.jpg,Micrograph of the red blood cells and the amino acid composition of the relevant portion of ?-chain of haemoglobin: (a) From a normal individual; (b) From an individual with sickle-cell anaemia Heterozygous (HbAHbS) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they are carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission of the mutant gene to the progeny thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait (Figure 4.15). The mutant haemoglobin molecule undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change in the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like structure (Figure 4.15).
Class_12_Figure 4.16.jpg,A representative figure showing an individual inflicted with Down’s syndrome and the corresponding chromosomes of the individual  Down’s Syndrome : The cause of this genetic disorder is the presence of an additional copy of the chromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21). This disorder was first described by Langdon Down (1866). The affected individual is short statured with small round head furrowed tongue and partially open mouth (Figure 4.16).
Class_12_Figure 4.17.jpg,Diagrammatic represe ntation of genetic disorders due to sex chromosome composition in humans : (a) Klinefelter Syndrome; (b) Turner’s Syndrome Klinefelter’s Syndrome : This genetic disorder is also caused due to the presence of an additional copy of Xchromosome resulting into a karyotype of 47 XXY. Such an individual has overall masculine development however the feminine development (development of breast i.e. Gynaecomastia) is also expressed (Figure 4.17 a) Turner’s Syndrome : Such a disorder is caused due to the absence of one of the X chromosomes i.e. 45 with  X0 Such females are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary besides other features including lack of other secondary sexual characters (Figure 4.17 b).
Class_12_Figure 5.1.jpg,A Polynucleotide chain Similarly at the other end of the polymer the sugar has a free OH of 3'C  group which is referred to as 3' -end of the polynucleotide chain.  The backbone of a polynucleotide chain is formed due to sugar and phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from the backbone (Figure 5.1).
Class_12_Figure 5.2.jpg,Double stranded polynucleotide chain  Similarly Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds. As a result always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This generates approximately uniform distance between the two strands of the helix (Figure 5.2).
Class_12_Figure 5.3.jpg, DNA double helix The plane of one base pair stacks over the other in double helix. This in addition to H-bonds confers stability of the helical structure (Figure 5.3)
Class_12_Figure 5.4a.jpg,Nucleosome The negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer to form a structure called nucleosome (Figure 5.4 a).
Class_12_Figure 5.4b.jpg,EM picture - ‘Beads-on-String’ The nucleosomes in chromatin are seen as ‘beads-on-string’ structure when viewed under electron microscope (EM) (Figure 5.4 b).
Class_12_Figure 5.5.jpg,The Hershey-Chase experiment Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did not enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic material that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 5.5).
Class_12_Figure 5.6.jpg,Watson-Crick model for semiconservative DNA replication After the completion of replication each DNA molecule would have one parental and one newly synthesised strand. This scheme was termed as semiconservative DNA replication (Figure 5.6).
Class_12_Figure 5.7.jpg,Meselson and Stahl’s Experiment Then they transferred the cells into a medium with normal 14NH4 Cl and took samples at various definite time intervals as the cells multiplied and extracted the DNA that remained as double-stranded helices.  The various samples were separated independently on CsCl gradients to measure the densities of DNA (Figure 5.7).
Class_12_Figure 5.8.jpg,Replicating Fork This creates some additional complications at the replicating fork. Consequently on one strand (the template with polarity 3' 5') the replication is continuous while on the other (the template with polarity 5' 3') it is discontinuous. The discontinuously synthesised fragments are later joined by the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 5.8).
Class_12_Figure 5.9.jpg,Schematic structure of a transcription unit It is a DNA sequence that provides binding site for RNA polymerase and it is the presence of a promoter in a transcription unit that also defines the template and coding strands.  By switching its position with terminator the definition of coding and template strands could be reversed. The terminator is located towards 3'-end (downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the process of transcription (Figure 5.9). 
Class_12_Figure 5.10.jpg,Process of Transcription in Bacteria The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the process of elongation.  It associates transiently with initiation-factor (?) and termination-factor (?) to initiate and terminate the transcription respectively. Association with these factors alter the specificity of the RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 5.10).
Class_12_Figure 5.11.jpg,Process of Transcription in Eukaryotes hnRNA undergoes additional processing called as capping and tailing. In capping an unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to the 5'-end of hnRNA. In tailing adenylate residues (200-300) are added at 3'-end in a template independent manner. It is the fully processed hnRNA now called mRNA that is transported out of the nucleus for translation (Figure 5.11).
Class_12_Figure 5.12.jpg,tRNA - the adapter molecule anticodon loopthat has bases complementary to the code and it also has an amino acid acceptor  end to which it binds to amino acids. tRNAs are specific for each amino acid (Figure 5.12). 
Class_12_Figure 5.13.jpg,Translation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to form a polypeptide (Figure 5.13). The order and sequence of amino acids are defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. The amino acids are joined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond.  Formation of a peptide bond requires energy.
Class_12_Figure 5.14.jpg,The lac Operon The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon.  In the presence of an inducer such as lactose or allolactose the repressor is inactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase access to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 5.14).
Class_12_Figure 5.15.jpg,A representative diagram of human genome project This required generation of overlapping fragments for sequencing.  Alignment of these sequences was humanly not possible. Therefore specialised computer based programs were developed (Figure 5.15).  These sequences were subsequently annotated and were assigned to each chromosome.
Class_12_Figure 5.16.jpg,Schematic representation of DNA fingerprinting: Few representative chromosomes have been shown to contain different copy number of VNTR.  For the sake of understanding different colour schemes have been used to trace the origin of each band in the gel.  The two alleles (paternal and maternal) of a chromosome also contain different copy numbers of VNTR.  It is clear that the banding pattern of DNA from crime scene matches with individual B and not with A detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography. A schematic representation of DNA fingerprinting is shown in Figure 5.16.

Class_12_Figure 6.2.jpg,"A family tree of dinosaurs and their living modern day counterpart organisms like
 crocodiles and birds  Different-aged rock sediments contain
 fossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of
 the particular sediment. Some of them appear similar to modern
 organisms (Figure 6.2). They represent extinct organisms (e.g., Dinosaurs).
 A study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological
 period in which they existed. "
Class_12_Figure 6.3.jpg," Example of homologous organs in
 (a) Plants and (b) Animals  This is divergent
 evolution and these structures are homologous.  Homology indicates
 common ancestry.  Other examples are vertebrate hearts or brains. In  plants also, the thorn and tendrils of
 Bougainvillea and Cucurbita represent
 homology (Figure 6.3a). Homology is
 based on divergent evolution whereas
 analogy refers to a situation exactly
 opposite. For example whales, bats, Cheetah and
 human (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs
 (Figure 6.3b).  Though these forelimbs perform different functions in these
 animals, they have similar anatomical structure – all of them have
 humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their
 forelimbs."
Class_12_Figure 6.4.jpg,"Figure showing white - winged moth and dark - winged moth (melanised) on a tree trunk (a) In unpolluted area (b) In polluted area Do you know
 that lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators? They will
 not grow in areas that are polluted.  Hence, moths that were able to
 camouflage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived
 (Figure 6.4). This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas
 where industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of
 melanic moths was low."

Class_12_Figure 6.7.jpg,"Picture showing convergent evolution
 of Australian Marsupials and
 placental mammals Placental mammals in Australia also
 exhibit adaptive radiation in evolving into
 varieties of such placental mammals each of
 which appears to be ‘similar’ to a corresponding
 marsupial (e.g., Placental wolf and Tasmanian
 wolf-marsupial). (Figure 6.7)."
Class_12_Figure 6.8.jpg,"Diagrammatic representation of the operation of natural selection on different traits : (a) Stabilising (b) Directional and (c) Disruptive Natural selection can lead to stabilisation (in
 which more individuals acquire mean character value), directional change
 (more individuals acquire value other than the mean character value) or
 disruption (more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both
 ends of the distribution curve) (Figure 6.8)."

Class_12_Figure 6.11.jpg,"A comparison of the skulls of adult modern human being, baby chimpanzee and
 adult chimpanzee. The skull of baby chimpanzee is more like adult human skull
 than adult chimpanzee skull They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees.
 Ramapithecus was more man-like while Dryopithecus was more
 ape-like. Few fossils of man-like bones have been discovered in Ethiopia
 and Tanzania (Figure 6.11). These revealed hominid features leading to
 the belief that about 3-4 mya, man-like primates walked in eastern Africa."
