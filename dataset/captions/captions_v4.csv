0,Class_12_Figure 1.1.jpg,A diagrammatic representation of L.S. of a flower To a biologist flowers are morphological and embryological marvels and the sites of sexual reproduction.  In earlier classes you have read the various parts of a flower.  Figure 1.1 will help you recall the parts of a typical flower. Flowers are objects of aesthetic ornamental social religious and cultural value they have always been used as symbols for conveying important human feelings such as love affection,C:\Users\student\Desktop\202418003\Minor Project\Class 12\dataset\images\Class_12_Figure 1.1.jpg

A typical angiosperm anther is bilobed with each lobe having two theca i.e. they are dithecous (Figure 1.2b). Often a longitudinal groove runs lengthwise separating the theca.,C:\Users\student\Desktop\202418003\Minor Project\Class 12\dataset\images\Class_12_Figure 1.2.jpg
2,Class_12_Figure 1.3.jpg,Transverse section of a young anther Enlarged view of one microsporangium showing wall layers A mature dehisced anther The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC) through meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores as they are formed are arranged in a cluster of four cellsthe microspore tetrad (Figure 1.3a).  As the anthers mature and dehydrate the microspores dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 1.3 b). Inside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen grains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther (Figure 1.3c).,C:\Users\student\Desktop\202418003\Minor Project\Class 12\dataset\images\Class_12_Figure 1.3.jpg

The gynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have more than one pistil (multicarpellary).  When there are more than one the pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 1.7b) or may be free (apocarpous) (Figure 1.7c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 1.7a) the stigma style and ovary.

7,Class_12_Figure 1.8.jpg,It is a large cell containing dense cytoplasm and a prominent nucleus. The MMC undergoes meiotic division. What is the importance of the MMC undergoing meiosis? Meiosis results in the production of four megaspores (Figure 1.8a). Let us study about the formation of the embryo sac in detail. (Figure 1.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles forming the 2 nucleate embryo sac. After the 8-nucleate stage cell walls are laid down leading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte or embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac (Figure 1.8b c).

9,Class_12_Figure 1.10.jpg,Wind pollination also requires that the pollen grains are light and non-sticky so that they can be transported in wind currents. They often possess well-exposed stamens (so that the pollens are easily dispersed into wind currents Figure 1.10) and large often-feathery stigma to easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind pollinated flowers often have a single ovule in each ovary and numerous flowers packed into an inflorescence,C:\Users\student\Desktop\202418003\Minor Project\Class 12\dataset\images\Class_12_Figure 1.10.jpg

The cycle starts with the menstrual phase when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. These changes in the ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 2.9).

A bioreactor provides the optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth conditions (temperature pH substrate salts vitamins oxygen).

119,Class_12_Figure 10.2.png,Host plant-generated dsRNA triggers protection against nematode infestation: (a) Roots of a typical control plants; (b) transgenic plant roots 5 days after deliberate infection of nematode but protected through novel mechanism. Using Agrobacterium vectors nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant (Figure 10.2). The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host cells. These two RNAs being complementary to each other formed a double stranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus silenced the specific mRNA of the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic plant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 10.2).,C:\Users\student\Desktop\202418003\Minor Project\Class 12\dataset\images\Class_12_Figure 10.2.png

In many species of fig trees there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp (Figure 11.4).  It means that a given fig species can be pollinated only by its partner wasp species and no other species.,C:\Users\student\Desktop\202418003\Minor Project\Class 12\dataset\images\Class_12_Figure 11.4.png

126,Class_12_Figure 12.1.png,Diagrammatic representation of decomposition cycle in a terrestrial ecosystem Similarly  decomposers break down complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon dioxide water and nutrients and the process is called decomposition. Dead plant remains such as leaves bark flowers and dead remains of animals including fecal matter constitute detritus which is the raw material for decomposition. The important steps in the process of decomposition are fragmentation leaching catabolism humification and mineralisation. Detritivores (e.g. earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles. This process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching watersoluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated as unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into simpler inorganic substances. This process is called as catabolism. It is important to note that all the above steps in decomposition  operate simultaneously on the detritus (Figure 12.1).,C:\Users\student\Desktop\202418003\Minor Project\Class 12\dataset\images\Class_12_Figure 12.1.png
